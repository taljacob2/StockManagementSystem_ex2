# make command "4" as tree view?
# make command "5" as a table?

# snowHills.jpg --- kill this or use this

# in the StockTablePaneController - tableView --- make `Price` be presented as $USD.

# change 'font' via a slider

# Aviad said that the main method should be on the 'javafx' module.
    is it okay to set the main as my MainUI eventhough its on the 'ui' module?

# -> write in README  that Filechooser is having ExtensionFilters to .FXML and ALL
        also, root setInitialDirectory is the current Project directory.

 # -> write in README  that in change of color theme, the label of "RSE" is
        white on dark colors, and black on bright colors.

         # -> write in README  that in change of color theme, the label of "Progress" is
                white on dark colors that are less than 150 total, and Colored on bright colors.

# fix that when using the "Animation" replacement there is an actual replacement.
    because now there is no corrent "remove" of the "oldPane"


# add an "icon" to the ".exe"

# add colors to labels of buttons

# reset the 'statusLabel' when clicking on any button.
    dot it by adding a 'resetLabel' call into every button ActionEvent.


# make "disable" to the menuVBox as long as there are no stocks in the system.

# fix progressBar is not progressing for some reason now.

# write in README -> that I made 5 types of Animations: available in the
"Settings" Menu.

# order "PaneAnimator" (and "PaneReplacer") that WONT be configured ONLY TO
JavaFXApp via
    JavaFXAppController.setReplaceAblePane(newPane); and
    JavaFXAppController.getReplaceAblePane();

    but needs to be generic!!

    # then, we can configure a "PaneAnimationHandlerJavaFXApp" that "extends"
        "PaneAnimationHandler" with the bond to JavaFX borderPane,
        parentContainer, and replaceAblePane.


# BUG ONLY ON FADE IN OUT ANIMATION - If you "SPAM" the click of PANE buttons,
    there would be panes that won't be removed. - Fix it.
